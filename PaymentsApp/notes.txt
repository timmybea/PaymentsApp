The Goal
To create a command line app called Payments that models an on-line payment module
The app will generate a random dollar value that simulates an online purchase and will display this to the user
The user will be asked to select from 3 payment methods: Paypal, Stripe or Amazon
Once they select a payment method the app processes the amount using the selected method
We will use delegation to accomplish this

How to Create a Protocol
A. Create a Protocol that defines what messages the delegate can receive.

@protocol GreeterDelegate

-(BOOL)shouldSayHello;

@end

B. Add a delegate property to your delegator

@property (nonatomic, weak) id<GreeterDelegate> delegate;

C. From your delegator, send messages to your delegate.

[self.delegate shouldSayHello];

D. Adopt the protocol in the definition of a class you've created.

@interface FriendlyGreetingDecider : NSObject <GreeterDelegate>;

E. Implement how your delegate responds to the methods in the protocol.

-(BOOL)shouldSayHello {

return YES;
}

F. Connect your delegator and delegate together.
greeter.delegate = greetingDecider;
